# Project Arcana Rules

## Note
*Version: 20170706*

This rule set is part of the alpha phase of development. There is no promise of a working game yet, just some vague guidelines to help develop the final rules.

## Combat
Combat is one of the central components of Project Arcana. Most of the player's time is spent in combat. There are two main types of combat: between the player and wild Arcana, and between the player and other arcana trainers.

### Rounds and Turns
A fight is broken down into rounds. There is always at least one round, but fights can go one for as long as both opponents are able to battle. A round is divided into turns, one for each arcana fighting.

### Beginning Wild Combat
To setup a wild battle, the player first "sends out" their first arcana. Then, an opponent is chosen based on the rules for the area. Usually by rolling dice against an encounter table.

### Round Start
At the beginning of each round, the speed stats of the arcana are compared. The one with the highest stat goes first.

### Player's Turn
When it's the player's turn, they may choose among four options: attacking, using an item, switching out arcana, or running from battle.

### Opponent's Turn
Unless stated otherwise by the rules of the area, all wild arcana will choose to attack on their turn. Which move they choose is determined by dice rolls.
