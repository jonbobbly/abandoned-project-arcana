# Project Arcana

## About this Project
Project Arcana is a pen and paper, solo RPG heavily based on the Pokemon games.

## Alpha Phase
The game is currently in the "alpha phase" of development. This is essentially a very early preview of what the game eventually be. Right now, there is no playable game since there are no rules, but as development progresses, a game should not only take shape, but should become more and more polished with time.
