Each round of battle is broken down into two turns: one for each combatant.
At the start of each round, the arcana with the highest speed stat is awarded the first turn.
In a turn, an arcana may do one of the following: use a move, use an item, swap with another in the party, or try to run away.
Physical, special, and status are the three categories of moves. Physical make contact, specials do not, and status changes a stat or condition.
Arcana and moves each have types. When the type of the user matches the move type, the move is 50% stronger.
Arcana types are strong against some types and weak against others. Strong attacks are 2x as good, weak attacks are 1/2x as good.
Items used in battle come in two types: those that affect stats, and items used to capture wild arcana.
Wild arcana have a capture rate that determines how difficult they are to catch.
Items can affect the capture rate of wild arcana such as stronger nets or bait that makes the wild arcana feel happier.
Arcana nets are the items used to capture arcana. They come in many varieties, each with their own use-case.
The moves of wild arcana are chosen at random with dice rolls.
Moves have a limited amount of use in battle before they arcana is too tired to use them.
Recovering 1 move point requires 1 minute of rest.
Time in the game only passes when the player takes an action. It has no relation with real time at all.
An arcana has a pool of move points equal to 5 + level. Moves cost different amounts of points to use.
